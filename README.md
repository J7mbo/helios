Helios is a GUI automation tool written in Go - it automates anything that you can see on your screen. Helios uses 
image recognition powered by OpenCV under-the-hood. You can use Helios to automate GUI testing, video games and more.

Example:

```go
package main

import (
	. "github.com/j7mbo/helios"
	"time"
)

func main() {
    // Initialise helios without any configuration
    app := NewApplication(nil)
    // Load .gopher.png and expect to find it at 0.9 / 1.0 confidence
    gopherImage, _ := NewImage("./gopher.png", 0.9)
    // Find the gopher image on-screen
    gopher := app.GetScreen().Find(gopherImage)
    // Highlight it for two seconds
    gopher.Highlight(2 * time.Second)
    // Click at a random (X,Y) coordinate within the matched box
    gopher.Click()
}
```

The Gopher from Goland, highlighted for 2 seconds:
